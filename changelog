1.4.1-py3.1
	- Adoption to Python3
	- Supporting TLS for SMTP authoring

1.4.1
    - A TIMEOUT option has been added to the .newsdeliverrc file which allows
      the user to specify their own timeouts for network operations.

1.4.0
    - NewsDeliver can now run in daemon mode and hold a persistent connection
      to the server.
    - Daemon will reload its group file if it receives a SIGHUP
    - SIGTERM should be handled properly now
    - Verbose output can now be logged to a file with the DEBUGFILE
      config option
    - Socket errors give a more general message instead of always saying
      'timed out.'
    - Fixed another error where a Python 'EOFError' would be displayed if
      the NNTP server disconnected unexpectedly.  This is now handled
      gracefully and displays an appropriate error message.

1.3.5
    - NNTPPORT option added to specify news server's port (defaults to 119)
    - EOFError while reading article headers is now properly caught and
      displays an appropriate message ("NNTP server closed connection while
      reading headers.")
    - New MAILERROR setting allows selection of behavior on SMTP errors:
      "IGNORE" causes SMTP errors to be ignored (so that a single spam
      message that gets rejected by SMTP-time mail servers doesn't clog
      the NewsDeliver process) and "FAIL" (the default) terminates
      immediately so that messages will not be lost.
    - try/catch for SMTPAuthenticationError has been moved into an if
      statement that will only be run if SMTP authentication is used.
      This exception (and the smtplib.login() function itself) only appear
      in Python 2.2 and above, so you must be using a relatively recent
      version of Python in order to use the SMTP authentication features.
      The missing exception should no longer cause problems for people
      who are not using authentication, but are running an older version
      of Python.

1.3.4
    - MAILCMD option allows use of external mail program
      (e.g., /usr/lib/sendmail) instead of using SMTP directly.
    - SMTPFROM global option and smtpfrom group option in
      .newsdeliver.grp allow user to set the address that is used for
      the 'MAIL From' line of the SMTP transaction

1.3.3
    - add support for SMTP authentication via SMTPUSER and SMTPPASS options
      in ~/.newsdeliverrc
    - fix a couple cases of "double unlocking" when an error occurs; this
      wasn't really a problem, but it caused a warning about "lockfile
      already gone"

1.3.2
    - supports uploading of messages to another NNTP server via
      IHAVE
    - Instances of %g in EXTRAHEADERS are replaced by the current newsgroup
      name; useful when filtering messages that have been cross-posted to
      multiple groups
    - temporary support for --rcfile on command line; this is a temporary
      hack to allow multiple servers; this will become unnecessary in the
      next real release when the config file format is updated to accomodate
      this
    - SMTPPORT setting is now actually honored

1.3.1
    - fixed bug in 'listgrps' code that caused a crash while
      listing the monitored groups

1.3.0
    - new .newsdeliver.grp file format
    - subject prefix can be set on a per-group basis
    - subject prefix can contain the string "%g" which will be
      replaced by the newsgroup name
    - cleaner code

1.2.1
    - NNTPUSER and NNTPPASS config variables can be set if the nntp
      server requires users to login.
    - Binary notifications now contain the Message-ID in the body
      so that the user can find the message in their regular newsreader
      easily.
    - Fixed a bug that made the remgrp command stop working

1.2.0
    - Binary detection added (can ignore, notify, or send normally).
      So far, only yEnc and uuEncode are detected.
    - If newsdeliver dies during a run, messages already sent are no
      longer forgotten and re-sent on the next run.
    - 'catchup' command is no longer broken
    - Added a 'list' command which displays a list of all groups being
      monitored, along with their subject filter (if any).

1.1.1
    - more Python 1.5 fixes (exception names from nntplib)

1.1.0
    - added --verbose to display debugging info
    - newsgroups can now have an associated subject line filter
    - newsgroups can now be directed at a specific email address,
      overriding the global default

1.0.3
    - Uses locking to make sure two processes don't try to run at once

1.0.2
    - Now works with Python 1.5

1.0.1
    - Fixed crash when a newsgroup's "last article number" jumps from 0
      to some high (>1) number.

1.0.0
    - Initial release
